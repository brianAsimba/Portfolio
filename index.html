                    <p>
                        Who is Brian Asimba? I was born in Nairobi, Kenya in a big family of 8 kids. My parents always worked
			    hard for us to have a better life, which gave me the morals of hard work and not giving up when
			    things get tough. As I was growing up I was always fascinated with airplanes.
			    It was in high school, junior year, when we were taught about airplanes and how they fly,
			    their forces and how they are designed. After this, I always wanted to be an Aeronautical 
			    Engineer and I began looking at the best places to study it. However, my country did not 
			    offer any degrees in this field. My passion brought me to Western Michigan University, 
			    which had a transfer program with Egerton University. Below is a summary of my work experience,
			    education and some of my short to long term goals.
